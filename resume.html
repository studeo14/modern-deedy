<p><strong>Teacher Assistant (TA):</strong> World Wide Web Information Systems Development</p>
<h1 id="work-experience">Work Experience</h1>
<p>Designed and implemented a dashboard using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong> to visualize data stored in <strong>DynamoDB</strong>, decreasing time to understand delivery driver work sessions by over 10 times.</p>
<p>Ensured only authorized employees have access to the application by creating an <strong>AWS Lambda@Edge</strong> function to intercept and sign valid requests.</p>
<p>Devised and deployed the infrastructure in TypeScript through <strong>AWS CDK</strong>, then created efficient algorithms to process data from a custom <strong>REST API</strong>, so it could scale to handle millions of deliveries.</p>
<p>Setup a CI/CD pipeline and exceeded requirements in each stage, which lead to the application being pushed to production.</p>
<p>Developed a Personal Health Record (PHR) system in <strong><a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a></strong> based on the theoretical model outlined in .</p>
<p>Applied the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10838-9_23">mCP-ABE</a> encryption scheme using the <a href="http://gas.dia.unisa.it/projects/jpbc/">JPBC</a> library, so patients have fine-grained access control over their health records with the ability to instantly revoke access.</p>
<p>Rewrote legacy <strong>Django code</strong> in <strong>Ruby in Rails</strong> and refactored it to make the system more extensible.</p>
<p>Created <strong>UML</strong> diagrams and documented where features were implemented, to make the codebase more maintainable.</p>

<p><br />
A security research tool to send targeted spam messages on either Facebook or Twitter. The program analyzes the feed of its target to increase the effectiveness of the messages.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
A full-stack image repository, where users can store their files. Created a GCP cloud function to implement <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bwaters/publications/papers/cp-abe.pdf">CP-ABE</a> encryption and used it to ensure files are secure at rest.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
A program that authenticates users based on their typing patterns. And a spoofer that uses the genetic algorithm to mimic the userâ€™s typing pattern.</p>
<p><br />
A distributed key-value store which automatically replicates data in the background while the user manages their data. Implemented a custom P2P protocol to maximize fault tolerance and scalability.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
A capture-the-flag-styled shooting game composed of AI-controlled players. The agents change their goals based on various factors, such as their health, current weapon, their personality and what they see.<br />
